### Challenge 1: Password Cracking with John the Ripper

- **Description:** This challenge involved cracking a password hash that was infected. Using the **John the Ripper** tool, I was able to successfully retrieve the plaintext password and obtain the flag.
- **Tools Used:** John the Ripper
- **Flag Location:** The flag was saved in a text file (`flag00.txt`).

- **Flag:** `flag{How_can_I_describe_my_emotions_at_this_catastrophe}`

### Challenge 2: Source Code Review

- **Description:** The second challenge required a thorough examination of the source code provided. After reviewing the code, I discovered a hidden vulnerability that led to the flag.
- **Tools Used:** Manual code review and static analysis tools

- **Flag:** `flag{Jack_Torrance_thought:_Officious_little_prick}`

### Challenge 3: Base64 Shifted Characters

- **Description:** In this challenge, the encoded string was base64 encoded with characters shifted around. I had to identify the pattern of shifting and correctly decode the base64 string to retrieve the flag.

- **Flag:** `flag{I_dont_want_to_stay_here}`

### Challenge 4: ASCII Code Decode

- **Description:** The fourth challenge required decoding an ASCII encoded message. By converting the ASCII values back to their corresponding characters, I was able to uncover the flag.

- **Flag:** `flag{I_do_not_propose_to_add_anything_to_what_has_already_been_written}`

### Challenge 5: Hex to ROT47 to Base64 Decode

- **Description:** This challenge involved multiple decoding steps. I first converted a hex string to its ASCII representation, then applied the ROT47 cipher, and finally decoded the result from base64 to obtain the flag.
- **Tools Used:** Hex conversion, ROT47, and base64 decoding
